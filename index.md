# About Me 
<img alt="A picture of me" src="./profile.jpg" style="height: 50vh; display: block; margin: 1em auto;">
I am Minh Duc Hoang (Damian/Duc), a third-year student at the University of Toronto pursuing a HBSc in Computer Science (Specialist/Honors) and minor in Statistics.<br/> 
I grew up in Hanoi, Vietnam and came to Toronto in 2018 to pursue higher education in one of the world most developed cities. Prior to university, I went to Hanoi-Amsterdam High school for the Gifted for a study in Physics where I meet many amazing people.

My research interests include: 
+ Computer Vision
+ Machine Learning 

In the previous year, I have the valuable experience to research on time-series prediction for infectious disease modelling using Neural Network. Inspired by Neural ODE structure, we produced interesting results in Black Sigatoka prediction. Our work won [Project X 2020](https://www.projectx2020.com/), a international research competition for undergraduate with the theme this year being 'Climate Change' and was awarded $20000. It is proudly presented on [University of Toronto's  website](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/prize-winning-u-t-student-team-uses-ai-beat-banana-blight), [UofT Department of Computer Science's website](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/news-events/news/how-to-beat-banana-blight-prize-winning-u-of-t-student-team-turns-to-novel-neural-network), and the school largest student run newspaper - [The Varsity](https://thevarsity.ca/2021/01/31/u-of-t-ai-conference-highlights-use-of-machine-learning-to-address-the-climate-crisis/?fbclid=IwAR1SEmYQSDbnNUrBu8yMl_rB-3I5QrvJ0uf3Yrs3UuzDxHq0wMNTkIPask0).

At the moment, I am reading & studying 3D Computer Vision and Visual Perception for Autonomous Driving vehicles in my free time. Starting May 2021, I will be joining Huawei as a co-op student in Toronto, ON.
